1. Problem Statement
Design an algorithm for playing Monopoly, where our attention will be on how a
player decides to buy, sell or trade and what influence decisions have on the
winning chances.
2. Explanation of Code
Monopoly is one of those strategic board games in which the players tend to
navigate around the board to acquire properties and try to acquire as much cash as
possible through rents or sales of properties to put other players into bankruptcy.
This will be difficult in terms of coming up with an algorithm that can maximize the
decision of a player to buy a particular property, build houses on it, or even trade it.
In short, it deals with calculating the probability, expected returns, and strategic
decisions that will ensure the optimal growth of a player's wealth and consequently
improve his or her chances of winning in the game.
